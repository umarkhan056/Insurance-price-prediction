# Insurance-price-prediction
This project predicts insurance prices using age, gender, BMI, children, smoker status. A Random Forest model is trained and evaluated for accuracy. Gradio creates an interactive interface for users to input their details and receive a predicted insurance price.

Here's a more detailed description:

"This project aims to predict insurance prices based on several key factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, and smoking status. It involves preprocessing the dataset, training a Random Forest regression model to learn patterns and relationships within the data, and evaluating the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R*R score).

The Random Forest model is chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and nonlinearities in the data, making it suitable for this prediction task. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and then tested on another portion to ensure its generalization ability and avoid overfitting.

Gradio, a user-friendly library, is utilized to create an interactive interface that allows users to input their personal information (age, gender, BMI, etc.) and receive a predicted insurance price based on the model's predictions. This interface simplifies the process for users and enhances accessibility to the insurance price prediction functionality.

Overall, this project combines data preprocessing, machine learning modeling with Random Forests, model evaluation, and user interface development to create a comprehensive solution for insurance price prediction."
